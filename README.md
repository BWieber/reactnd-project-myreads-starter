# MyReads Project

This application allows a user to search for books from a sample database and to organize those books into categories.
Some books are seeded for you initially, to let you experiment with the categorization functionality. Upon clicking the button
in the bottom right of the screen, a user may enter text into the input to perform a search. These search terms are supported: https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-myreads-starter/blob/master/SEARCH_TERMS.md

Upon seeing search results, a user can then categorize books into the various categories. They can click the left facing arrow in the input to return to their bookshelves. 


## Launch Project in Development Environment

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`

## Important
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.
